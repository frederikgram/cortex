Digital content such as videos has become one of the primary marketing platforms, in this space, advertisements have quickly become an ingrained part of content
itself, this is especially true in the age of Adblockers, now making many traditional digital
advertisements partly obsolete. Cortex uses various computer vision approaches to analyze videos and livestreams from platforms such as YouTube and Twitch.tv, giving advertisers insight
into how much screen-time their advertisements are actually visible to viewers.
